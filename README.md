# Scripts
## 00_source
Loads all required libraries/packages and runs the pipeline. All dependencies should be specified in the source script.   
## functions
Loads all custom functions used in the pipeline into the environment. Also serves as function documentation. 
## 01_create_dirs
Creates ```data/``` and its folder substructure. Also runs a function to validate that you stored your .las files into the right folder. If you cloned the pipeline using git, this script effectively completes the pipeline's folder structure (as ```data``` and its subdirectories contain large files and are thus listed in ```.gitignore```). 
## 02_clip_classif
Clips your point clouds using a rectangular and circular buffer centered around the coordinate system origin. Also classifies ground points using a CSF - Cloth Simulation Function (see LidR docu or various papers). Note that the CSF parameters must be adjusted to your point clouds to produce good results. Adapting the function to work with LidR's other ground classification options should be relatively straightforward if you so desire. Saves the clipped and classified point clouds in a different folder. 
## 03_dtm_normalize_height
Normalizes point cloud heights using either of three methods implemented in LidR. Saves the normalized point clouds in a different folder.
## 04_dtm_chm_dsm_generation
Generates digital terrain models, canopy height models and digital surface models of your point clouds as rasters and creates very basic overview figures to visually assess the results. The accuracy of the generated models mostly depends on the ground classification accuracy. We used Lidr's implementation of the pitfree algorithm to avoid pits in the output raster. Rasters are then exported into the correct folder. 
## 05_whole_stand_pai
Estimates PAI for vertical slices of a given thickness following an approach laid out by [Flynn et al. 2023](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/20/2769/2023/) and [Li et al. 2016](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07038992.2016.1220829?journalCode=ujrs20). Utilizes code from the Flynn et al. paper. For each slice, PAI is calculated as $(Correction factor * (Number of voxels containing returns within the slice/Total number of voxals within the slice))$. For this to work, voxels need to be quite small. The appropriate voxel size is to be determined by the user. A smaller voxel size increases stand level PAI estimates but reduces the amount of slices with PAI = 0 caused by occlusion effects and vice versa. 

The estimatePAI function also wraps a function to modify the point cloud density and extent. The script returns .csv tables with the estimated PAI of each slice and a whole stand summary displaying the resolution of calculation, stand-level PAI, the Z height of the highest voxel (dominant height).

# FAQ
## Why did you use ```here()``` instead of relative filepaths? 
If you cloned this repo using Git and opened the R project, it will automatically be set as the working directory and relative filepaths should work just fine. However, ```here()``` from the [here](https://here.r-lib.org/) package is superior to relative filepaths, because it calls on your operating systems filepath logic to reference a filepath. This means filepaths referenced using here do not have to be changed to be readable by UNIX-based systems. Moreover, it is easier to find and exchange directories within the filepath because directories are function arguments instead of parts of a huuuuge string. 

## Where did your ominuous runtime estimates come from?
I used the [microbenchmark](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/microbenchmark/) package to estimate the runtime of all scripts and functions at least once. I did not export the results, but they're probably system dependent as well. 

## What are the Examiner folders?
Examiner folders are output folders for singular outputs. The pipeline is written to process a bunch of files in batch, but if you want to examine the results of one specific function, you can change the output filepath to an Examiner folder.

## Why does the pipeline export so many .las files?
I think there's no way around it. The ground classification must be saved in order to be useable for other operations - I tried processing in batch without intermediate saves, but I would recently run into memory shortages - it's just too much stuff to have in the environment. There is probably a super smart way around this, either by optimizing the function logic or by parallel processing, but I have not looked to much into it. Ultimately, I just put the ground classification and clipping into one operation at the very start of the pipeline.

## I want to adapt the pipeline to use for my own files, what do I have to look after? 
I have not tried adapting the pipeline for different files, but I put some effort into keeping it clean and interchangeable and it should not be hard to adapt it. I think the main cause of trouble will be your filename naming convention. All scripts use ```gsub()``` to remove file endings and unnecessary string parts from the filepath list strings. Since the arguments are based on our file naming convention,
```gsub()``` will probably remove either too much or too little. Just adapt how many characters are removed from the strings:
```
filenames <- path_file(input.filepaths)
filenames <- gsub('.{0,10}$', '', filenames)
```
Another source of trouble might be the buffer coordinates. The coordinate system we used is centered on a temperature logger in the center of the plots, which makes buffering super straightforward and simple to implement. The clip and classify tool also assumes your point clouds coordinate system origin is always so same - make sure it is.

## I want to use a different buffer to clip?
The clip function is written in a way that it accepts rectangular and spherical buffers passed to it by the ```buffer.method``` argument. If you want something else, you will have to go adjust the function logic accordingly, which should not be too hard to do. Check the LidR documentation for buffer options. Also the buffer's primary purpose at this point is to reduce point cloud size and later scripts such as ```whole_stand_pai.R``` offer to buffer again.

## What is the logic behind the coordinates given to the rectangle buffer?
The rectangle buffer is drawn from a bottom left and a top right point. The coordinate origin depends on your coordinate system which makes a strong argument for setting a coordinate system origin in the center of your plot. Since our coordinate systems is centered on the temperature logger, negative coordinates or either in front or left of the sensor, positive coordinates are right or behind it. With a 40 m square buffer, my bottom left point was -20, -20 and the top right point 20, 20.
